# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to find trends within the Kickstarter data. The data represents many different campaings with many different outcomes, the purpose of the analysis was to demonstrate the campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on the information provided by the Kickstarter database a pivot table and line chart were created. The pivot table provided below shows all the data organized by the months of the year on column 'A', column 'B' provides the successful campaigns, column 'C' provides the amount of cancelled campaigns and finally column 'E' provides the grand total of campaigns per month. The user can also filter the data using the toolbars in the top left corner of the pivot table, filter options include years and the type of campaigns held. Attached is also a line chart.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In this sheet I created a pivot chart demonstrating the outcome based on the goals of each campaign specifically based on 'plays'. On column 'A' show the goal  based on the dollar amount. The following columns demonstrate the number of successful, failed and canceled depending on the goal amount. Line cahrt also provide; y axis demonstrate the percenatge of succesful, failed or canceled projects and the x axis demonstrate goal amount ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The challenges and difficulties were encountered when plugging in numbers into the the =COUNTIFS formula, numbers in the smaller ranges were causing trouble because of the amount of campaigns that shared the same 'goal range'. Ways to overcome this obstacle was to review the kickstarter data set precisely. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The primary two conclusions made were that campaigns launched in the middle of the year were far more successful then campaigns launched at the end of the year. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The conclusion based on this data set demonstrates that campaigns that had a less of a goal to reach had a higher chance of being successful. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Based on the the data set provided one of the limitations found were that the deadline and launch date were not specified clearly.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Graph charts and box-whisker plots.
